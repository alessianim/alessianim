⊰⊹🍥 Hi, I’m Alessia Jenien.
⊰⊹☕ I’m interested in books, theories and debates.
⊰⊹🍸 I’m currently taking Bachelor of Science in Accountancy as pre-law, aiming for law school after I finish taking the CPA board examination.
⊰⊹🍡 As for my personality, anything may vary depending upon your behavior and attitude towards me. I could be benevolent and I could be hostile. Your choice.
⊰⊹🍣 I dislike noisy and crowded places, it seems very suffocating and uncomfortable.
